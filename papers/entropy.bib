abstract = {The subdivision of protein structures into smaller and independent structural domains has a fundamental importance in understanding protein evolution and function and in the development of protein classification methods as well as in the interpretation of experimental data. Due to the rapid growth in the number of solved protein structures, the need for devising new accurate algorithmic methods has become more and more urgent. In this paper, we propose a new computational approach that is based on the concept of domain as a compact and independent folding unit and on the analysis of the residue-residue energy interactions obtainable through classical all-atom force field calculations. In particular, starting from the analysis of the nonbonded interaction energy matrix associated with a protein, our method filters out and selects only those specific subsets of interactions that define possible independent folding nuclei within a complex protein structure. This allows grouping different protein fragments into energy clusters that are found to correspond to structural domains. The strategy has been tested using proper benchmark data sets, and the results have shown that the new approach is fast and reliable in determining the number of domains in a totally ab initio manner and without making use of any training set or knowledge of the systems in exam. Moreover, our method, identifying the most relevant residues for the stabilization of each domain, may complement the results given by other classification techniques and may provide useful information to design and guide new experiments.},

abstract = {We develop a general minimally coupled subspace approach (MCSA) to compute absolute entropies of macromolecules, such as proteins, from computer generated canonical ensembles. Our approach overcomes limitations of current estimates such as the quasi-harmonic approximation which neglects non-linear and higher-order correlations as well as multi-minima characteristics of protein energy landscapes. Here, Full Correlation Analysis, adaptive kernel density estimation, and mutual information expansions are combined and high accuracy is demonstrated for a number of test systems ranging from alkanes to a 14 residue peptide. We further computed the configurational entropy for the full 67-residue cofactor of the TATA box binding protein illustrating that MCSA yields improved results also for large macromolecular systems.},

abstract = {The HIV-1 gp120/CD4 interaction shows a large, unprecedented entropy/enthalpy compensation, with the capacity to fine-tune recognition over a broad range of affinity. The intermolecular interaction involves stable hydrophobic contacts with a unique protruding CD4-Phe43 structure surrounded by an intermolecular hydrogen-bond network that covers the hemisphere of the CD4 D1 domain. We have applied a heuristic formula based on the covariance matrix of atom-positional fluctuations to assess the configurational entropy of the gp120/CD4 complex at different levels. The system was dissected into various subsets of atoms to evaluate the entropic contributions of different functional elements. By combining the trajectories of the free and complex forms, further insight into the conformational sampling was extracted. Despite the limited sampling time of 10 ns, the theoretically derived changes in configurational entropy are in fair agreement with the experimentally determined data. The simultaneous evaluation of different interaction modes through a decomposition approach is only feasible with the knowledge of the atomic trajectory of the system. The configurational entropy analysis in terms of combined trajectories presented here shall potentially provide accurate estimations of thermodynamic properties of biomolecules given sufficient sampling of conformational space.},

abstract = {The results of minimal model calculations indicate that the stability and the kinetic accessibility of the native state of small globular proteins are controlled by few "hot" sites. By means of molecular dynamics simulations around the native conformation, which describe the protein and the surrounding solvent at the all-atom level, an accurate and compact energetic map of the native state of the protein is generated. This map is further simplified by means of an eigenvalue decomposition. The components of the eigenvector associated with the lowest eigenvalue indicate which hot sites are likely to be responsible for the stability and for the rapid folding of the protein. The comparison of the results of the model with the findings of mutagenesis experiments performed for four small proteins show that the eigenvalue decomposition method is able to identify between 60{\%} and 80{\%} of these (hot) sites.},

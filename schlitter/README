Schlitter
---------
Computes the Schlitter entropy of a given molecular structure (PDB format)
and trajectory (Gromos96 format). The trajectory is expected to be
free of rigid body motions, i.e. rotations and translations have been
removed already.

Install / Uninstall
-------------------
Run the './bootstrap' shell script to initialise the GNU Autotools.
You need to have the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) installed.
Standard GSL installations wil be detected by the './configure' script,
otherwise use the '--with-gsl=<path>' switch upon configuration
(run './configure --help' for all configuration options).

In case the Autoconf version is too old, run
% autoconf --version
and use the result to replace the version number in configure.ac
AC_PREREQ([2.59])
to reconfigure with the bootstrap script.

The configuration option '--enable-debug' creates a debuggable binary,
the option '--enable-profiling' enables profiling with 'gprof'.

For automatic code documentation execute 'doxygen doxygen.cfg'
in the 'src' directory.
Documentation files are created in 'doc/html' and 'doc/latex'.
The latex documentation is completed by executing 'make pdf' in the
'doc/latex' directory, which creates 'refman.ps' and 'refman.pdf'.

Install / Uninstall
-------------------
Run the 'bootstrap' shell script,
set the environment GMXDIR variable (use setenv if you have t/csh)
% export GMXDIR=/usr/local/gromacs
and follow the general 'INSTALL' instructions.

In case the Autoconf version is too old, run
% autoconf --version
and use the result to replace the version number in configure.ac
AC_PREREQ([2.59])
to reconfigure with the bootstrap script.

The configuration option '--enable-debug' creates a debuggable binary,
the option '--enable-profiling' enables profiling with 'gprof'.

For automatic code documentation execute 'doxygen doxygen.cfg'
in the 'src' directory.
Documentation files are created in 'doc/html' and 'doc/latex'.
The latex documentation is completed by executing 'make pdf' in the
'doc/latex' directory, which creates 'refman.ps' and 'refman.pdf'.
